* Documnetation:
- ChatGPT was primarily used to assist with documentation, such as writing the introduction and theoretical explanations in the README file. At times, information was provided to the AI for drafting, and the generated content was later refined by me.

* Coding: 
- Assisted in understanding how to use SymPy to define functions in the newton_solver code.
- Helped in defining strain arrays with various shapes to use as inputs for the elastoplasticity model.
